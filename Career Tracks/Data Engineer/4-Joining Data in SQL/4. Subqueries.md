#  SUBQUERIES

The joins are all "additive" in that they add columns to the original "left" table.

## Additive joins:

```
SELECT *
FROM left_table
INNER JOIN right_table
ON left_table.id = right_table.id
```

Semi join

A semi join chooses records in the first table where a condition is meet in the second table.

Returns all values from left_table where values of lt.col1 are in rt.col2

```
SELECT president, country, continent
FROM presidents
WHERE country IN
    (SELECT country
    FROM states
    WHERE indep_year <1800);
```

Anti Join

The anti join chooses records in the first table where lt.col1 does NOT find a match in rt.col2.

```
SELECT president, country
FROM presidents
WHERE continent LIKE '%America'
    AND country NOT IN
    (SELECT country
    FROM states
    WHERE indep_year <1800);
```



## MULTIPLE WHERE CLAUSES

Find all records from economies2019 where gross_savings in economies2015 were below the 2015 global average, using code to filter the economies2019 records.

```
SELECT * 
FROM economies2019
WHERE code in 
(SELECT code
FROM economies2015
where gross_savings<22.5)
```

## SEMI JOIN

```
-- Select country code for countries in the Middle East
SELECT code
FROM countries
where region = 'Middle East'
```

```
-- Select unique language names
SELECT distinct name
FROM languages
-- Order by the name of the language
order by name;
```

```
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM languages
-- Add syntax to use bracketed subquery below as a filter
where code IN
    (SELECT code
    FROM countries
    WHERE region = 'Middle East')
ORDER BY name;
```


## DIAGNOSING PROBLEMS USING ANTI JOIN
Interested in identifying currrencies of Oceanian countries. The following code returns 15 records.

```
SELECT c1.code, name, basic_unit AS currency
FROM countries AS c1
INNER JOIN currencies AS c2
ON c1.code = c2.code
WHERE c1.continent = 'Oceania';
```
We want to return if there are any oceanian countries excluded.

```
SELECT code, name
FROM countries
WHERE continent = 'Oceania'
-- Filter for countries not included in the bracketed subquery
  AND  code not in
    (SELECT code
    FROM currencies);
```


## SUBQUERY INSIDE WHERE

* All semi joins and anti joins were included a subquery in WHERE.

* WHERE is the most common place for subqueries

```
SELECT *
FROM some_table
WHERE field IN (4,8,12)
```

```
SELECT *
FROM some_table
WHERE field IN 
    (incluide subquery here);
```

* The query will work if some field is of the same data type as some numeric field.

```
SELECT *
FROM some_table
WHERE field IN 
    (SELECT SOME_FIELD
    FROM another table
    WHERE field2 = some_condition);
```

```
-- Select average life_expectancy from the populations table
SELECT avg(life_expectancy) 
FROM populations
-- Filter for the year 2015
WHERE year = 2015
```
```
SELECT *
FROM populations
-- Filter for only those populations where life expectancy is 1.15 times higher than average
WHERE life_expectancy > 1.15*
  (SELECT AVG(life_expectancy)
   FROM populations
   WHERE year = 2015) 
    AND year = 2015;
```



## WHERE DO PEOPLE LIVE?


```
-- Select relevant fields from cities table
select name, country_code, urbanarea_pop
-- Filter using a subquery on the countries table
from cities
where name in 
    (SELECT capital
    from countries)
ORDER BY urbanarea_pop DESC;
```


## SUBQUERY INSIDE SELECT


```
SELECT DISTINCT continet,
    (SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM monarchs
    WHERE states.continent = monarch.continent) AS monarch_count
FROM states
```

```
-- Find top nine countries with the most cities
SELECT countries.name AS country, COUNT(*) AS cities_num
FROM countries
LEFT JOIN cities
ON countries.code = cities.country_code
GROUP BY country
-- Order by count of cities as cities_num
ORDER BY cities_num DESC, country
LIMIT 9;
```
```
SELECT countries.name AS country,
-- Subquery that provides the count of cities   
  (SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM cities
   WHERE countries.code = cities.country_code) AS cities_num
FROM countries
ORDER BY cities_num DESC, country
LIMIT 9;
```

## SUBQUERIES INSIDE FROM


```
SELECT continent, MAX(indep_year) as most_recent
FROM states
GROUP BY continent;
```

```
SELECT DISTINCT monarch.continent, sub.most_recent 
FROM monarch,
    (SELECT continent,
    MAX(indep_year) as most_recent
    FROM states
    GROUP BY continent) AS sub
WHERE monarchs.continent = sub.continent
ORDER BY continent;
```


## SUBQUERY INSIDE FROM


```
-- Select code, and language count as lang_num
SELECT code, COUNT(*) AS lang_num
FROM languages
GROUP BY code;
```

```
-- Select local_name and lang_num from appropriate tables
SELECT local_name, sub.lang_num
FROM countries,
    (SELECT code, COUNT(*) AS lang_num
     FROM languages
     GROUP BY code) AS sub
-- Where codes match    
WHERE countries.code = sub.code
ORDER BY lang_num DESC;
```

```
-- Select relevant fields
select code, inflation_rate, unemployment_rate
from economies
WHERE year = 2015 
  AND code NOT IN
-- Subquery returning country codes filtered on gov_form
	(select code
  from countries
  where gov_form like '%Republic%' or gov_form like '%Monarchy%')
ORDER BY inflation_rate;
```

## SUBQUERY INSIDE CHALLENGE

From cities, select the city name, country code, proper population, and metro area population, as well as the field city_perc, which calculates the proper population as a percentage of metro area population for each city (using the formula provided).

Filter city name with a subquery that selects capital cities from countries in 'Europe' or continents with 'America' at the end of their name.

Exclude NULL values in metroarea_pop.
Order by city_perc (descending) and return only the first 10 rows.


```
-- Select fields from cities
SELECT 
	name, 
    country_code, 
    city_proper_pop, 
    metroarea_pop,
    city_proper_pop / metroarea_pop * 100 AS city_perc
FROM cities
-- Use subquery to filter city name
WHERE name IN
  (SELECT capital
   FROM countries
   WHERE (continent = 'Europe'
   OR continent LIKE '%America'))
-- Add filter condition such that metroarea_pop does not have null values
	  AND metroarea_pop IS NOT NULL
-- Sort and limit the result
ORDER BY city_perc DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
